# foobar2000-skins-collection
A collection of skins for foobar2000 audio player.
---

I've been searching for a fb2k collection skins repo, but I didn't find so I decided that it's a must to have something similar.

This repository is a curated list of skins that I have gathered from various sources to provide a comprehensive resource for foobar2000 enthusiasts.

If someone have other skin in mind which we can add to the repo, feel free to do so.
